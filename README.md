# car-search-helper
This is the first capstone project using an API from an external source and integrating it, into my website.  The API used was from Edmunds to get recalls and technical service bulletins data from their database so that the user could research problems about their car and/or future car.

## Getting Started
To get the project running on your local machine just need to setup a local server and load the index.html file.
